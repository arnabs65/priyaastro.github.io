								I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. My work is at the exciting intersection of X-ray and infrared observations, focusing on a diverse range of astronomical objects including X-ray binaries, high-redshift galaxies, and galaxy clusters. I am a Guest Scientist to NASA/JAXA's flagship X-ray mission <b><a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xrism/" target="_blank">XRISM</a></b> and a key contributor to the <b><a href="https://www.lem-observatory.org" target="_blank">Line Emission Mapper (LEM)</a></b> — a proposed NASA X-ray micro-calorimeter probe mission.

								I am deeply involved in the development of two widely used astrophysics codes: I lead the X-ray aspects of <b><a href="https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy" target="_blank">CLOUDY</a></b> and serve as an associate lead for <b><a href="http://www.atomdb.org" target="_blank">AtomDB</a></b>. My journey in astrophysics began with a PhD under the mentorship of <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Ferland"target="_blank">Dr. Gary J.

								<blockquote>
								  Priyanka was an awesome TA! When I was able to speak with her one-on-one she was sooooo helpful and wanted me succeed. Allowed us to ask questions and for help. She took her time to answer questions. Always friendly and eager to help. She always helped with questions and was able to provide feedback on labs as we were doing them. Very helpful in assisting us navigate the sometimes daunting lab setups. <cite>[Physics 213, Fall 2017]</cite>
								</blockquote>
								  
								<br>
								<blockquote>
								  She was very helpful and graded fairly. She made herself available to answer questions and was very respectful of students. She was always ready to help and very clear with instructions. <cite>[Physics 211, Fall 2018]</cite>
								</blockquote>

								<br>
								<blockquote>
								  She was there to help when needed and was very patient. She made sure that the important equations and reasons were on the board for the students to access. Helped us not flounder around looking for answers in the wrong places or if we were missing information. <cite>[Physics 241, Fall 2019]</cite>

							<p class="pa1">
								For me, service naturally extends beyond the classroom. By giving public lectures, making media appearances, reviewing work and supporting underprivileged students, I see service as a way to inspire growth, share knowledge, and create opportunities for those who might otherwise be left behind.
							</p>

							<p class="pa1">
								My highest form of service has always been my students, as a supervisor, and as a teacher. This dedication shapes each project I devise, every lecture I prepare, every paper I grade, and every piece of advice I offer. Through each interaction, I strive to inspire and guide, firmly believing that my students' achievements are the truest measure of my service.
